# Final-Project-Web-Design-Blog-Lekturloka
On November 2021, I created a final project of blog web design. It's developed as a passing requirement for students of Palcomtech OPI Mall Course Institute to obtain a computer diploma degree. My project was chosen as the best project among the other students and I got the scholarship from the course institute.
